        <p>Cookie is the cheekiest monkey around, always swinging from tree to tree with a mischievous grin. With a love for sweet treats (especially cookies), sheâ€™s quick to make new friends and even quicker to find trouble. But her infectious laughter and adventurous spirit always make up for her playful pranks.</p>
