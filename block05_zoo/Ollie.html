        <p>Meet Ollie, a friendly and curious bear with a heart as big as the forest he roams. Known for his playful nature and love of adventure, Ollie spends his days exploring the wilderness, making friends with woodland creatures, and finding the juiciest berries. With a soft, brown coat and a gentle smile, Ollie’s the kind of bear who can’t help but spread warmth wherever he goes. </p>
