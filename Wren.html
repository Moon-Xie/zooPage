        <p>Wren is a cool-headed and confident alligator who prefers to keep things low-key. Known for her quiet strength and razor-sharp focus, Wren spends her days sunbathing on the riverbank or gliding silently through the water. She may seem mysterious at first, but those who get to know her discover a loyal and thoughtful friend.</p>
